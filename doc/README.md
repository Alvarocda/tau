## Licenses

Flutter Sound 8.3 was published under the LGPL License.
A Flutter Sound developer noticed recently that this [license was incorrect](https://github.com/Canardoux/tau/issues/696) :
the LGPL license does not allow static links to the library. The library must be linked dynamically.
The problem was that Flutter links-edit the plugins statically. This means that many Flutter Sound users who
use our library in private/close sources App was in a copyright infringement.

To solve this issue, we forked Flutter Sound 8.3 to two different branches.

* [Flutter Sound 8.4](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_sound) is published under the permissive Mozilla Public License 2.0.
* The Ï„ Sound Project 9.0 (this fork) is published under a pure GPL License.

Ï„ Sound is copyrighted by Canardoux (2021).

* Ï„ Sound is released under a license with a *strong copyleft* clause: the GPL-V3 license. This means that if you use total or part of Ï„ Sound, your App must be published under the GPL License too.
* If you cannot (or don't want to) publish your App under the GPL License, perhaps you can consider using the MPL [Flutter Sound 8.4 branch](https://tau.canardoux.xyz/readme.html).

## We need help

Ï„ is a fundamental building block needed by almost every mobile project.

We are looking to make Ï„ the go to project for mobile Audio with support for various platforms and various OS.

Ï„ is a large and complex project which requires to maintain multiple hardware platforms and test environments.
