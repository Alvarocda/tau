## 9.0.0-alpha.6

- Tau Sound and tau-native are now published under GPL3.0 . [FS #696](https://github.com/Canardoux/tau/issues/696). See [here](tau_sound_birth-post.html)
- Tau Sound FULL is now correctly linked with Flutter_ffmpeg. This means that if the App needs to access flutter_ffmpeg, it can use either the FULL flavor or the LITE flavor as it wants. [install](https://tau.canardoux.xyz/flutter_sound_install.html#ffmpeg). Goodbye the old hack :-)
- A new API V9 is offered (beta). Please refer to [this migration guide](links_migration_v9). The V6 API continues to be supported (backward compatibility is ensured) thanks to deprecated classes.
- Not necessary anymore to do any include inside index.html for Tau Sound on Web. We probably will have less Problem Reports from Ï„ users not able to run their Web App.
- Remove the stupid assets in tau_web [FS #402](https://github.com/Canardoux/tau/issues/402)
